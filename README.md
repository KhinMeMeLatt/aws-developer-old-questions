## Old Question 2

1. A company is implementing an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application needs to process incoming transactions. When the application detects a transaction that is not valid, the application must send a chat message to the company's support team. To send the message, the application needs to retrieve the access token to authenticate by using the chat API.

Add a resource-based policy to the parameter to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Parameter Store. Retrieve the token from Parameter Store with the decrypt flag enabled. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat.</li>
 <li>Encrypt the access token by using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Store the access token in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access DynamoDB and AWS KMS. Retrieve the token from DynamoDDecrypt the token by using AWS KMS on the EC2 instances. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat.</li>
 <li>Use AWS Secrets Manager with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to store the access token. Add a resource-based policy to the secret to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Secrets Manager. Retrieve the token from Secrets Manager. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat.
</li>
 <li>Encrypt the access token by using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key. Store the access token in an Amazon S3 bucket. Add a bucket policy to the S3 bucket to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Amazon S3 and AWS KMS.

153. A company uses a custom root certificate authority certificate chain (Root CA Cert) that is 10 KB in size to generate SSL certificates for its on-premises HTTPS endpoints. One of the company’s cloud-based applications has hundreds of AWS Lambda functions that pull data from these endpoints. A developer updated the trust store of the Lambda execution environment to use the Root CA Cert when the Lambda execution environment is initialized. The developer bundled the Root CA Cert as a text file in the Lambda deployment bundle.

After 3 months of development, the Root CA Cert is no longer valid and must be updated. The developer needs a more efficient solution to update the Root CA Cert for all deployed Lambda functions. The solution must not include rebuilding or updating all Lambda functions that use the Root CA Cert. The solution must also work for all development, testing, and production environments. Each environment is managed in a separate AWS account.

502. A company generates SSL certificates from a third-party provider. The company imports the certificates into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to use with public web applications.

A developer must implement a solution to notify the company’s security team 90 days before an imported certificate expires. The company already has configured an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. The company also has configured an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that has the security team’s email address as a subscriber.

Which solution will provide the security team with the required notification about certificates?

<ol type="A">
 <li>Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that specifies the ACM Certificate Approaching Expiration event type. Set the SNS topic as the EventBridge rule’s target.</li>
 <li>Create an AWS Lambda function to search for all certificates that are expiring within 90 days. Program the Lambda function to send each identified certificate’s Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in a message to the SQS queue.</li>
 <li>Create an AWS Step Functions workflow that is invoked by each certificate’s expiration notification from AWS CloudTrail. Create an AWS Lambda function to send each certificate's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in a message to the SQS queue.</li>
 <li>Configure AWS Config with the acm-certificate-expiration-check managed rule to run every 24 hours. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that includes an event pattern that specifies the Config Rules Compliance Change detail type and the configured rule. Set the SNS topic as the EventBridge rule’s target.</li>

507. A developer has implemented an AWS Lambda function that inserts new customers into an Amazon RDS database. The function is expected to run hundreds of times each hour. The function and RDS database are in the same VPC. The function is configured to use 512 MB of RAM and is based on the following pseudo code:
     <code>
      def lambda_handler(event, context):
          db = database.connect()
          db.statement('INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName) VALUES (event.name)')
          db.execute()
          db.close()
     </code>
     
After successfully testing the function multiple times, the developer notices that the execution time is longer than expected.

What should the developer do to improve performance?

<ol type="A">
 <li>Increase the reserved concurrency of the Lambda function.</li>
 <li>Increase the size of the RDS database to facilitate an increased number of database connections each hour.</li>
 <li>Move the database connection and close statement out of the handler. Place the connection in the global space.</li>
 <li>Replace Amazon RDS with Amazon DynamoDB to implement control over the number of writes per second.</li>
